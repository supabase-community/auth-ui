> [!IMPORTANT]  
> As of 7th Feb 2024, this repository is no longer maintained by the Supabase Team. At the moment, the team does not have capacity to give the expected level of care to this repository. We may revisit Auth UI in the future but regrettably have to leave it on hold for now as we focus on other priorities such as improving the Auth Helpers and advanced Auth primitives.

> The repository itself will continue to exist and a subset of components within the Next.js ecosystem, such as Forgot Password Pages, will be iterated on. We will continue to keep the latest packages for frameworks available at `@supabase/auth-ui-svelte`.

> We would like to thank everyone for your contributions to the repository. Please feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or concerns.

> Thank you.

# Supabase Auth UI

Supabase Auth UI is a collection of pre built UI components that work seamlessly with @supabase/auth-helpers.

The main purpose of these components is to allow developers to get working on their apps quickly, but also be able to use their own style/css.

Auth UI is kept deliberately separate from @supabase/auth-helpers so that developers can migrate away from pre-built UI components as their UI system naturally matures.

  - `@example/react`: a [React.js](./examples/react) app
  - `@example/solid`: a [Solid.js](./examples/solidjs) app
  - `@example/svelte`: a [Svelte](./examples/svelte) app
- Packages
  - `@supabase/auth-ui-react`: the supabase auth ui reactjs library used by `react` application
  - `@supabase/auth-ui-solid`: the supabase auth ui solid.js library used by `solid.js` application

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Localization

Localizations are no longer distributed with the package in order to keep the package size small. You can now import the localization you need by copying the file from this repo and importing it into your project then passing it to the `localization.variables` param of the Auth component.

```tsx
import { Auth } from '@supabase/auth-ui-react'
import * as ja from './path-to-localization-file.json'
...
<Auth
  supabaseClient={supabase}
  localization={{
    variables: ja
  }}
/>
...
```
