# Supabase Auth UI React

Supabse Auth UI is a collection of pre built UI components that work seamlessly with @supabase/auth-helpers.

The main purpose of these components is to allow developers to get working on their apps quickly, but also be able to use their own style/css.

Auth UI is kept deliberatly seperate from @supabase/auth-helpers so that developers can migrate away from pre-built UI components as their UI system naturally matures.
